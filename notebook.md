# Notebook

Here you can colllect notes about your thought process, or other
things you think we'll be interested in.

Steps:

1- Create 5 dice with 6 faces
2- The dice has to create random numbers from 1 to 6.
3- Import needed `from random import randint`
4- Check if there is two-of-a-kind number after roll
5- Check if there is three-of-a-kind number after roll
6- Code refactoring(Not done)
7- Testing (Not done)

Extra notes:

I have managed to check if there is a two-of-a-kind and three-of-a-kind. I wanted to try to refactoring code and test the functions.
I did runout of time as by doing that I would have use more time than suggested.
I did not used any additional dependences for this test.
